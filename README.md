## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS ExpressJS, Framer Motion, Figma

I first designed the Pokedex UI in Figma then translated the design to code using CSS. I utilized Flexbox and Grid to position the components and React to change the states of these components dependent on user input. Since I wanted experience working with the backend, I separated the project into client and server components. Here, NodeJS and ExpressJS create the server that operates at a local port used to retrieve, process, and serve the Pokemon data to the client. This server served was used during my testing as a standalone server. While deploying though, I integrated this server into NextJS as an API endpoint. Finally, I added animations using Framer Motion to tie everything together and give the project a more fluid experience.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that UI designing is actually a very time consuming process. However, I found myself enjoying the brainstorming and turning the sketches into a functional and pleasing interface.
My previous project Lam Types was developed with strictly HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this project, I attempted using React for the first time, but it felt quite natural. I really like the way React and JSX work in unison to abstract the tedious document selectors and make rendering rather simple. I came to realize how much of a time saver libraries and frameworks play in projects.
