## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Framer Motion, Figma

I first designed the Pokedex UI in Figma then translated the design to code using Css. I utilized Flexbox and Grid to position the components and React to change the states of these components dependent on user input. Since I wanted experience working with the backend, I separated the project into client and server components. Here, Express creates the server that operates at a local port that I use to retrieve, process, and serve the Pokemon data to the client. Finally, I added animations using Framer Motion to tie everything together and give the project a more life like experience.
