## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Framer Motion, Figma

I first designed the Pokedex UI in Figma

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to manipulate DOM elements using JS, fetch from an API, and use AddEventListeners to listen for user inputs. I really enjoyed working on this project while figuring out the intricacies of working with the basics of basics. Looking back, I had finished this project without knowing the existence of React or any other frontend frameworks. Because of this, I learned to appreciate React and how it helps developers speed up code and optimize for performance without the nitty gritty verbose details.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
